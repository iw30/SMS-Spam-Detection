# Project Description

In this project, I will build a predictive model that will accurately detect which texts are spam using Phyton. The accuracy of the model reaches up to 95.4%.

# Dataset

The dataset is obtained from kaggle in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset?select=spam.csv)

The dataset contains 2 columns: the first column tells whether the text message is ham or spam and the second column containing the text message.
